### Support Our School Through Donations

Our Board deeply values your generous support, which helps bring to life our vision for an exceptional primary school education. While the Charter School Agency funding provides a foundation, your contributions bridge the gap, enabling a vibrant, engaging, and inclusive learning environment for all students.

Every contribution, no matter the size, directly impacts the lives of our students and the quality of their education. Thank you for being an integral part of our school‚Äôs journey and for helping us shape a bright future for all our learners.

This year‚Äôs donation has been set at $550 per student.

Direct Credit to EFIA bank account `06-0323-0901946-00`. Please state your name in the _Particulars_ field, and "Donation" as the reference.

A receipt will be provided upon receiving the donation, allowing you to apply for a tax credit with the IRD since the school is registered as a charitable trust.

Thank you so much! üôè
