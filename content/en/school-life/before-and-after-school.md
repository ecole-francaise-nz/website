### Before-School and After-School Activities Organised by the French Alliance

The school offers Before-School care from 7:30 am until 8:15 am at 131 Remuera Road.

The school also offers an After-School programme from 3:00 pm to 5:30 pm at 131 Remuera Road.

This gives children the opportunity to review their homework with a French-speaking supervisor and take part in relaxing and fun activities after school. 

Bookings for both programmes will be done through [Enrolmy](https://enrolmy.com/alliance-francaise-auckland/book-now/1-Before-and-After-School-) once parents/caregivers have created an account.

Here is how the programme works:

* Parents register their child and pay directly through Enrolmy, based on the chosen option:
  * 7:30 - 8:15 am: $15 per session
  * 3:00 - 4:00 pm: $15 per session
  * 3:00 – 5:30 pm: $29 per session
* Payment is required before the service starts.
