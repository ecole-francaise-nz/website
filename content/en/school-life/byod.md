# Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) – Starting in CM1 / Year 5

BYOD is a great opportunity for your child to develop their digital literacy skills and learn about the care and responsibility associated with technology.

## Choice of device
EFIA exclusively uses web-based tools such as services from Google Workspace for Education. As a result, any device with a web browser can be used.

However, we recommend avoiding iPads and other tablets, as they don’t always provide a sufficiently ergonomic environment for many applications.

Suggested devices:

* A Chromebook, with at least 8 GB of RAM, and an SSD drive. This is the most cost-effective solution, and the one we strongly recommend.
* A Windows laptop, with at least 8 GB of RAM and an SSD drive.
* A MacBook, with at least 8 GB of RAM and an SSD drive.

When purchasing, please consider the following:

* A protective case or bag
* Headphones (ideally bluetooth for safety)
* A mouse

If you purchase a Chromebook and your child wishes to use this before the beginning of the school year, please ensure that the primary account loaded onto the device is your child's school account. This will ensure they can access their device at school when we return in January.

## Cybersafety

The school filters internet access to provide a secure environment, and students will use a school-managed Chrome Browser to access online resources. Students do not require email accounts to access the educational applications and programs that we use at school. Social media accounts are blocked at school.

To ensure your child is ready for school next year, both you and your child will need to sign the [BYOD Letter of Understanding and the Cybersafety Contract](/efia_2026_byod_letter_of_understanding_and_cybersafety_contract.pdf). These documents must be returned to the school before your child can use their device at school. Please read through these carefully with your child to ensure they understand what they are agreeing to.

For more information on our I.T. security measures, please read the [Computer Security and Cybersecurity](/computer_security_and_cybersecurity_v1_05_02_2026.pdf) document.
