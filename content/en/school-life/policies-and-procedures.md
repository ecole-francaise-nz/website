SchoolDocs provides us with a comprehensive core set of policies and procedures, which have been well-researched and align with the National Education and Learning Priorities. The policies and procedures have been tailored to our school.
Our school board has the opportunity to view changes and to comment on them before they are implemented. We will advise you when policies and procedures are up for review and how you can take part in the review.

Visit [SchoolDocs](https://ecolefrancais.schooldocs.co.nz/) to access the policies and procedures:

- Username: `ecolefrancais`
- Password: _provided by the school when the student starts_

Also read our [behaviour management plan](/behaviour_management_procedure_v1_23-01-2025.pdf).

We also follow the [guidelines of the ministry of education](/final_star_30_jan_2025.pdf) regarding families not attending school regularly.
