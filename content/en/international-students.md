### Potential learning outcomes

Bilingual education offers significant cognitive benefits, enhancing problem-solving, critical thinking, and multitasking skills. Switching between two languages promotes mental flexibility, making children more adaptable learners.

Beyond language proficiency, bilingualism fosters cultural awareness and empathy, essential traits in today’s globalized world. Studies also show that bilingual students often outperform monolingual peers in academic assessments due to their enhanced cognitive abilities.

We provide additional language support for students who need help in either language. Our bilingual approach ensures strong literacy development in both French and English.

Most of our students are English speakers with no prior connection to French, and our teachers adapt their strategies to support their learning. Thanks to small class sizes and tailored pedagogy, we have seen remarkable progress.

We also benefit from the Alliance Française’s expertise, with their specialized teachers providing individualized support for students learning French. Similarly, we offer ESOL support for Francophone students who are new to English.

Students follow the French curriculum and assessments. However, we also prepare them for New Zealand assessments, including the e-asTTle system, from Year 3 onward. This allows students to seamlessly transition between the French and New Zealand mainstream curriculums at any point.
