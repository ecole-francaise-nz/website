A bilingual international school offering a high-quality French curriculum, enriched by New Zealand's curriculum and pedagogical approaches.

In the French curriculum, the education is organized into five learning areas during the 1st Cycle (Grande section / Year 0/1):

1. To mobilize the language in all its dimensions
2. To act, to express, to understand through physical activity
3. To act, to express, to understand through artistic activities
4. To built the first tools to structure the thought
5. To explore the world

From Cycle 2 on, the curriculum is structured around five core domains that define the major educational goals:

1. Languages for thinking and communicating: Students are taught how to understand and express themselves while using 4 types of language:

   - French;
   - Other modern or regional languages
   - Mathematic, scientific, and technological languages;
   - Language of the arts and the body.

2. Methods and tools for learning: Students are taught how to:

   - Learn, individually or collectively, in class or outside of class,
   - Access information and documents,
   - Technological methods,
   - How to lead individual or collective projects,
   - How to organize their studies and the knowledge they have accumulated.

3. Personal and civic development: This domain focuses on learning societal life, collective action, and citizenship through moral and civic education, respectful of personal choices and individual responsibilities. The core values and principles embedded in the Constitution are passed on.

4. Natural and technical systems: This area is centered on the scientific and technical understanding of Earth and the Universe, aiming to develop curiosity, observation skills, and problem-solving abilities.

5. Representations of the world and human activity: Students develop spatial awareness of geography and history by understanding societies within their respective environments. They learn to interpret human cultural expressions and gain a deeper understanding of the contemporary world.

The New Zealand Curriculum provides eight learning areas: English, the Arts, Health and Physical Education, Learning Languages, Mathematics and Statistics, Science, Social Sciences, and Technology as well as five key competencies: Thinking; Using language, symbols, and texts; Managing self; Relating to others; Participating and contributing.

These eight learning areas and five key competencies will be integrated seamlessly with the core knowledge, skills, and cultural foundation of the French curriculum.

Therefore students will also be exposed to the excellent soft skills offered by the New Zealand curriculum, by developing their presentation skills while enhancing their self confidence, self awareness and social skills, notably openness, empathy and kindness towards others.
