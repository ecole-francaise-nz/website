The school is growing every year and is looking for French‑speaking teachers who have experience with the French National Education curriculum. To be authorised to teach in our school, teachers must obtain their teacher registration from the New Zealand Teaching Council. For this, their qualifications must be recognised by NZQA, and an English test is also required.

Details of the procedure can be found on the [NZ Teaching Council](https://teachingcouncil.nz/getting-certificated/) and [NZQA](https://www2.nzqa.govt.nz/) websites, and it can be completed from overseas. If you are already living in New Zealand and are in the process of becoming registered, or if you wish to begin this process, you may also contact us to discuss potential opportunities at: [hr@ecole-francaise.nz](mailto:hr@ecole-francaise.nz).

All the information are available on the [French Embassy's website](https://nz.ambafrance.org/Enseigner-en-Nouvelle-Zelande).
