**🌊  Water Safety Awareness & Survival Skills Programme**

Our students are benefiting from the following programme with [King’s Swim School](https://kings.school.nz/swim-school/): Water Safety Awareness & Survival Skills Programme.

This initiative is part of a trial programme designed to enhance water safety knowledge and survival capabilities across various age levels.

The sessions are aligned with the national [Water Skills For Life (WSFL)](https://www.waterskills.org/) framework, developed by [Water Safety New Zealand](https://www.watersafetynz.org/).
