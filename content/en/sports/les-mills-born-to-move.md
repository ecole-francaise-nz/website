We have a collaboration with [Les Mills](https://www.lesmills.co.nz/) to bring the [BORN TO MOVE™ programme](https://www.lesmills.com/borntomove/) to our students.

**Inspiring young people to fall in love with physical activity**

This programme is designed to nurture a lifelong passion for movement and fitness. It helps children experience the joy and vitality of moving to music, while building their confidence, energy, and overall health.

Key highlights of the programme:

* Tailored for core developmental stages, with classes for children aged 2-5 and 6-16
* Fun, interactive sessions that align with children’s natural appetite for action, movement, and play
* Delivered by our certified Les Mills instructor, Elodie Rodriguez
