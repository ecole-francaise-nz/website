Here's what parents had to say about our school:

---

*Before coming to Ecole Française Internationale, our son did not speak a word of French. Despite living in an Anglophone household, we were attracted to the school and curriculum as we see great value in learning a foreign language and being exposed to other cultures. After only one week, he was teaching us colours and animal names in French. After two weeks, he was confidently recalling a large number of nouns and numbers. And now, after only 1 month at Ecole Française Internationale, he can sing songs in French, he knows the names of emotions, animals, days of the week, months and many more French words and phrases. The feedback, updates and materials provided by the teachers give us a very clear understanding of the areas our son is progressing in.*

*Outside of the outstanding language teaching, we have been impressed with other aspects of the School. Our son is exposed to a range of stimulating activities and subjects including maths, sports and English. We were initially unsure how learning French alongside English would affect his reading and writing, but we have been amazed by his sudden progression in his English reading ability and confidence. He is exposed to a number of books, and the method of teaching phonics and reading is working very well for him. Every night, he enjoys reading books to us provided by the School and he is confidently sounding out and sight-reading words (including Māori words). The care and attention the staff have paid to him has given us the confidence that they are tracking his progress and providing him with suitable books and resources that match his ability.*

*All of the staff have been incredibly welcoming, friendly and professional. We could not be happier with our son's progress overall and he is settling in very well.*

*Our 7-year-old son started at EFIA recently, and we couldn’t be happier with how well he’s doing. From the very first day, he felt welcome and comfortable. The small classes and caring teachers make learning fun and easy for him.*

*One of the biggest surprises is how fast he’s learning French. He didn’t know any before, but now he picks up new words every day and enjoys using them at home. He’s always excited to share what he learned at school, whether it’s a new word, a fun fact, or something interesting from class.*

*He also loves the weekly tennis and racquet classes at the racquet club. It’s a great way for him to stay active, have fun, and try something new.*

*What we love most is the warm and supportive community. Everyone knows each other, and the teachers really care. Seeing our son happy, learning, and excited to go to school every day makes us sure we made the right choice.*

*As a parent of a gifted learner, I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it can be to keep my son engaged in school when he feels the content is too easy. However, our experience with the bilingual education program at EFIA has been transformative. We decided to explore the school’s dual language immersion program as a way to provide my son with the intellectual challenge he craved — even though he had no prior foundation in French.*

*What’s been remarkable is how quickly he adapted to 3½ days of French instruction each week. In a short period of time, he’s made impressive strides in both vocabulary and grammar. His ability to connect ideas and understand language structures has been eye-opening.*

*This experience has not only enhanced his academic engagement, but also his cognitive development. Studies have shown that dual language immersion can positively impact executive function, creativity, and cognitive abilities. We’ve seen this reflected in my son's improved focus and his ability to recall detailed information about what he’s learned each day — a clear sign of increased engagement.*

*Moreover, the small class sizes and passionate teachers have allowed him to receive personalized attention and progress in multiple ways. He’s even become more aware of global issues, such as pollution and recycling, showing a maturity in his thinking that goes beyond traditional classroom learning.*

*Overall, the bilingual education program has provided my son with the challenge, engagement, and development he needed. I’m excited to see where this educational journey takes him.*
