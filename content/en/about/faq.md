**Is EFIA a unique educational opportunity in New Zealand?**

Yes, EFIA is the only primary school in New Zealand that teaches the French curriculum in a bilingual setting (English & French).

---
**What are the advantages of bilingual education?**

Bilingual education offers significant cognitive benefits, enhancing problem-solving, critical thinking, and multitasking skills. Switching between two languages promotes mental flexibility, making children more adaptable learners.

Beyond language proficiency, bilingualism fosters cultural awareness and empathy, essential traits in today's globalized world. Studies also show that bilingual students often outperform monolingual peers in academic assessments due to their enhanced cognitive abilities.

---
**Does my child need to speak French before enrolling?**

No prior French knowledge is required. Our curriculum supports beginners while also challenging native and fluent speakers.

---
**Is EFIA a full-time school?**

Yes, EFIA operates as a standard five-day-a-week primary school, just like other New Zealand schools.

---
**For students who are not native French or English speakers, what kind of language support do you provide to help them thrive in a bilingual learning environment?**

We provide additional language support for students who need help in either language. Our bilingual approach ensures strong literacy development in both French and English.

Most of our students are English speakers with no prior connection to French, and our teachers adapt their strategies to support their learning. Thanks to small class sizes and tailored pedagogy, we have seen remarkable progress.

We also benefit from the Alliance Française’s expertise, with their specialized teachers providing individualized support for students learning French. Similarly, we offer ESOL support for Francophone students who are new to English.

---
**What are the class sizes?**

We maintain small class sizes to provide individualized attention and effective bilingual instruction.

---
**Will students take standardized tests in New Zealand?**

Students follow the French curriculum and assessments. However, we also prepare them for New Zealand assessments, including the e-asTTle system, from Year 3 onward.

---
**Are the teachers registered with the NZ Teaching Council?**

Currently, all three of our teachers are registered with the NZ Teaching Council and hold French teaching qualifications. In the future, we may have a mix of 75% NZ-registered teachers and 25% teachers with a Limited Authority to Teach (such as French teachers from overseas while their qualifications are assessed by NZQA).

---
**Are there Kiwi teachers at EFIA to ensure strong English literacy?**

Yes. EFIA teaches the French curriculum with 70% instruction in French and 30% in English. The English portion is currently taught by a native English speaker. As the school grows, we will hire additional native English-speaking teachers to ensure students transitioning to the NZ system do so smoothly.

---
**How does your school integrate the French curriculum with the NZ education system?**

At École Française Internationale Auckland, we blend the academically rigorous French curriculum with key aspects of the New Zealand curriculum, including English instruction, local history, culture, and well-being.

Our approach is contextualized—instead of learning about French geography, students explore New Zealand landmarks like the Waikato River and Mount Ruapehu. For ANZAC Day, young students will learn about poppies, ANZAC biscuits, and draw parallels with November 11th in Europe.

As a bilingual school, we teach in both languages, and our students sit the same NZ exams as other primary schools. In Term 1, they study English poems by NZ authors, and in Term 2, they will learn French poems by Francophone authors, not necessarily from France.

---
**What kind of facilities does the school offer to support students’ sports and cultural environment?**

We partner with Remuera Rackets Club, just a 5-minute walk away, for sports twice a week. Our students benefit from tennis and fitness coaching, including the Born To Move program by Les Mills. In Term 4, they will also have access to the swimming pool.

To meet our 2.5-hour weekly physical education requirement, students engage in 30 minutes of daily physical activity at school on days they don’t visit the club. We provide equipment to help them stay active and develop new skills.

We are fortunate to benefit from the Alliance Française, Auckland’s French cultural hub, giving us access to the largest French children’s library, holiday programs, and family-friendly events year-round.

However, we go beyond French culture, incorporating local themes into our teaching. At the end of Term 2, we will focus on Matariki and explore its connections to other cultural festivals.

---
**What guarantees does AEFE accreditation provide?**

AEFE (The Agency for French Education Abroad) accredits international schools that meet the academic and cultural standards of the French education system. AEFE accreditation grants access to:
* A global network of 600 schools in 139 countries, educating 398,000 students (2023 figures).
* Exclusive international programs such as the Young Ambassadors initiative, Worldwide French School Orchestra, Olympiades, and International Youth Games.
* Educational, cultural, and sports projects that connect students worldwide.

EFIA is currently undergoing the AEFE accreditation process, which typically takes about two years.

---
**Are there additional costs beyond free tuition?**

Yes, families should be aware of:
* A school uniform.
* A voluntary school donation to support outdoor activities and sports partnerships.
