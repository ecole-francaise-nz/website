**Is EFIA a unique educational opportunity in New Zealand?**

Yes, EFIA is the only primary school in New Zealand that teaches the French curriculum in a bilingual setting (English & French).

---
**What are the advantages of bilingual education?**

Bilingual education offers significant cognitive benefits, enhancing problem-solving, critical thinking, and multitasking skills. Switching between two languages promotes mental flexibility,
making children more adaptable learners.

Beyond language proficiency, bilingualism fosters cultural awareness and empathy, essential traits in today's globalized world. Studies also show that bilingual students often outperform monolingual peers in academic assessments due to their enhanced cognitive abilities.

---
**Does my child need to speak French before enrolling?**

No prior French knowledge is required. Our curriculum supports beginners while also challenging native and fluent speakers.

---
**Is EFIA a full-time school?**

Yes, EFIA operates as a standard five-day-a-week primary school, just like other New Zealand schools.

---
**How do you support children who struggle with French or English?**

We provide additional language support for students who need help in either language. Our bilingual approach ensures strong literacy development in both French and English.

---
**What are the class sizes?**

We maintain small class sizes to provide individualized attention and effective bilingual instruction.

---
**Will students take standardized tests in New Zealand?**

Students follow the French curriculum and assessments. However, we also prepare them for New Zealand assessments, including the e-asTTle system, from Year 3 onward.

---
**Are the teachers registered with the NZ Teaching Council?**

Currently, all three of our teachers are registered with the NZ Teaching Council and hold French teaching qualifications. In the future, we may have a mix of 75% NZ-registered teachers and

25% teachers with a Limited Authority to Teach (such as French teachers from overseas while their qualifications are assessed by NZQA).

---
**Are there Kiwi teachers at EFIA to ensure strong English literacy?**

Yes. EFIA teaches the French curriculum with 70% instruction in French and 30% in English.
The English portion is currently taught by a native English speaker. As the school grows, we will hire additional native English-speaking teachers to ensure students transitioning to the NZ system do so smoothly.

---
**Will students face challenges transitioning to an NZ intermediate school?**

The French curriculum is academically rigorous, ensuring that students gain extensive knowledge across subjects. Additionally, we implement a Kiwi pedagogical approach to facilitate smooth transitions for those moving into the NZ education system.

---
