**🌿 Our journey to becoming an Enviroschool**

_From March to November 8, 2025. 🌱_

What began as an empty space has blossomed into a growing dream that has always been part of our school’s vision to become an [Enviroschool](https://enviroschools.org.nz/).

This garden is more than soil and plants; it’s a living classroom where learning, care, and nature come together.

A heartfelt thank you to [OKE Charity](https://oke.org.nz/) for guiding and supporting us on this journey.

Our first Working Bee demonstrated what a community can achieve when purpose meets passion. Together, we are not just growing a garden; we are nurturing a future built on sustainability, respect, and teamwork. Thank you to every volunteer, student, and whānau member who gave their time, energy, and heart. 💚

Stay tuned to see how this garden continues to grow.
