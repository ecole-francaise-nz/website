**Auckland French International School** (École Française Internationale Auckland) is a new international school offering the French curriculum, enhanced with key competencies from the New Zealand curriculum, and taught in both French & English.

### Vision

To offer every student educational excellence as well as cultural openness via a multilingual learning environment that fosters knowledge, reflection, creativity, independence, social commitment, community spirit and a strong sense of citizenship.

The school also takes into account the New Zealand Statement of National Education and Learning Priorities (NELP): learners at the center, barrier free access, quality teaching and leadership, future of learning and work and world class inclusive public education. These priorities are also an integral part of the French education ideal and at the center of our vision, policies and educational strategies.

### Values

Our school's ethos is grounded in key principles that reflect our values and practices. These principles form the foundation of our students' education and prepare them to become global citizens:

- **Excellence in education**: EFIA offers an international, bilingual French-English education, blending the academic rigor of the French curriculum with the hands-on, student-centered approach of New Zealand curriculum and pedagogy.
- **Inclusivity and diversity**: EFIA welcomes students from all backgrounds, promoting a multicultural and inclusive environment that celebrates differences and fosters intercultural understanding.
- **Holistic development**: EFIA aims to provide a balanced educational experience, combining the strengths of both the French and New Zealand educational systems. Our programme nurtures studentsʼ academic growth while also developing life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
- **Community engagement**: Located at 131 Remuera Road, the school is embedded in the vibrant French community, supported by the Alliance Française dʼAuckland. Students will benefit from a rich cultural environment, participating in events like the French market and various community activities.
- **Continuous improvement**: AEFE accreditation and regular comparison with other French schools abroad ensure that EFIA remains committed to excellence and improvement.
- **Ethical leadership**: EFIA is built on a foundation of transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct, values that have been upheld by the Alliance Française dʼAuckland since its founding in 1896.

This is a unique educational opportunity in New Zealand, allowing students to seamlessly transition between the French and New Zealand mainstream curriculums at any point.

New year levels will be added annually, up to the French Baccalaureate. Eventually, the school will offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) Bilingual Programme in French and English for Years 12 and 13.

The school aims to achieve accreditation from the [Agency for French Education Abroad (AEFE)](../learning/aefe/) within two years.
