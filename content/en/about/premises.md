The school is located in the Remuera neighborhood ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iRTgtRV3pyQCjkkE7)), just a stone's throw from the Newmarket station.

Families are encouraged to use public transportation, as several bus lines stop nearby (#75,751 & 781). The Newmarket train station is an 11-minute walk away.

Additionally, the school promotes carpooling and family walking-buses to reduce traffic and environmental impact. There are also several parking spaces in the area.
