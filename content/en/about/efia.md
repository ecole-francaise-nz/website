This is a unique educational opportunity in New Zealand, allowing students to seamlessly transition between the French and New Zealand mainstream curriculums at any point.

The school will open in February 2025 in Remuera with three classes: Year 0/1 (Grande Section), Year 2 (CP), and Year 3 (CE1). All children are welcome, whether or not they come from French-speaking families.

New year levels will be added annually, up to the French Baccalaureate. Eventually, the school will offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) Bilingual Programme in French and English for Years 12 and 13.

The school aims to achieve accreditation from the Agency for French Education Abroad (AEFE) within two years.

Below is a comparative presentation of the French and New Zealand class level correspondences to help clarify the French curriculum we plan to offer:
