**High-Quality Teaching Team and Native Speakers**

All of our teachers will hold **qualifications recognized by the Ministries of Education in France and New Zealand.**

- **The French curriculum will be taught by French teachers** whose qualifications are recognized by the French Ministry of Education and who have experience teaching in primary schools in France.

- **A native English-speaking teacher will lead English lessons** and teach non-linguistic subjects such as sports, art, technology, or science.

Some of our teachers not only have experience teaching in France but have also lived in New Zealand for many years and have taught here, making them familiar with the New Zealand curriculum and pedagogy.

ðŸ‘‰**[AEFE](/curriculum/aefe) accreditation** (from the Overseas French Schools Agency) includes a review process to ensure the teaching staff have the necessary qualifications and experience to teach the French curriculum, providing parents with a guarantee of quality.
