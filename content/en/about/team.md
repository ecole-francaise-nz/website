## High-Quality Teaching Team and Native Speakers

All of our teachers will hold **qualifications recognized by the Ministries of Education in France and New Zealand.**

- **The French curriculum will be taught by French teachers** whose qualifications are recognized by the French Ministry of Education and who have experience teaching in primary schools in France.

- **A native English-speaking teacher will lead English lessons** and teach non-linguistic subjects such as sports, art, technology, or science.

Some of our teachers not only have experience teaching in France but have also lived in New Zealand for many years and have taught here, making them familiar with the New Zealand curriculum and pedagogy.

> **Born into biculturalism** with an English mother and a French father, I have been a teacher for many years, initially in France and now in New-Zealand since 2016.
> In addition to a French masterâ€™s in education, I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in international business administration from a top French business school. I worked in the corporate sector in sales and logistics before turning to teaching.
> Education is what lights my fire. **I believe in the power of education to transform lives** and open pathways to freedom. I am ecstatic to be part of the EFIA adventure where we will strive to offer the best of two worlds, delivering the highly academic and rigorous French curriculum with a distinctive Kiwi flavour.
