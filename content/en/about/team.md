## High-Quality Teaching Team and Native Speakers

All of our teachers will hold **qualifications recognized by the Ministries of Education in France and New Zealand.**

- **The French curriculum will be taught by French teachers** whose qualifications are recognized by the French Ministry of Education and who have experience teaching in primary schools in France.

- **A native English-speaking teacher will lead English lessons** and teach non-linguistic subjects such as sports, art, technology, or science.

Some of our teachers not only have experience teaching in France but have also lived in New Zealand for many years and have taught here, making them familiar with the New Zealand curriculum and pedagogy.

> **Born into biculturalism** with an English mother and a French father, I have been a teacher for many years, initially in France and now in New-Zealand since 2016.
> In addition to a French masterâ€™s in education, I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in international business administration from a top French business school. I worked in the corporate sector in sales and logistics before turning to teaching.
> Education is what lights my fire. **I believe in the power of education to transform lives** and open pathways to freedom. I am ecstatic to be part of the EFIA adventure where we will strive to offer the best of two worlds, delivering the highly academic and rigorous French curriculum with a distinctive Kiwi flavour.

> I graduated with a Master of Education and, in 2018, decided to travel to the other side of the world. New Zealand, with its rich culture and stunning landscapes, has always attracted me, and today, I am proud to call this country my home.
> As a registered and qualified teacher in New Zealand, I have gained years of experience, both as a classroom teacher and as a head teacher (team leader). A passionate sports enthusiast, I have also been a Les Mills instructor for 15 years. I continue to teach classes at various clubs, primarily at Les Mills Auckland City.
> Recently, I embarked on a new adventure that combines my creativity with my teaching practice. I am writing an educational book for children and developing different learning materials through stories and music.
> I look forward to starting my new role as a deputy principal in February 2025 and to meeting all of you!

> I have been **in charge of FLAM** (French as a Mother Tongue) **and FLE** (French as a Foreign Language) **classes at the Alliance FranÃ§aise** for the past two years. I am thrilled to be joining the French school and teaching the French curriculum at the primary level starting in 2025.
